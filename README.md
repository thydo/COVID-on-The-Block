# Introduction 
Based on the prizes and awards, we used that to decide a theme for our project. 
It boiled down to doing something for the *common good* and to integrate it with *cloud technology* (AWS/Google Cloud). 
Taking an approach similar to how *carrd.co* sites were made (e.g. BLM, crises, social movements), resources were available, but hardly mappable. 
People would often have to scroll through docs, Twitter threads, or pages with lots of links, resulting in harder to find resources that may be important. 

Enter: COVID on the Block. https://covidontheblock.org  

# Design 
Keeping minimalism in mind, we put everything someone may need during this pandemic into one central location. We mapped every single place in Maricopa to help point people to the resources they need: foodstuffs, shelter, medical supplies, testing centers, emergency rooms, unemployment, and even local community resources! This way, anyone wanting to find something can go onto our website and directly find and get the help they want and/or need.
